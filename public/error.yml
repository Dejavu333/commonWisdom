expected: We have specific strategy for expected errors.
unexpected: We don't have specific strategy for unexpected errors. Complementary to expected errors.
critical: The execution cannot continue.
noncritical: The execution can continue.
already raised: The error has already been raised by not our code.
bubble up: An outer scope handles in the same component (let's say frontend).
pass downstream: A downstream component handles it (let's say some backend service).
