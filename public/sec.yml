VPN: hides the IP from the destination
  there is a vpn client and a vpn server the client makes connection to the server
  the vpn client can be the router not the software on the user's device (otherwise if you only use vpn software on one machine in your network
  then a guest who logs in to instagram from his phone from your network now your geolocation is paired)
  so the target only sees the ip of the vpn server and not the user's original ip
  if the vpn server don't collect logs they can't provide anything to goverment
  if there's a listener from an agency at the vpn server they can see the incoming connections source ip
  ip address as default don't show location data but some apps gets your geolocation data and pairs it with your ip and sells it as a pair
  the vpn company can sell your data
  instead of a vpn you can use tor

malicious DLL: |
  One is static linking where you link everything when the program is compiled and effectively create a copy of each and every function that is referenced within the executable code itself. The major downside to this is that if you have 20 programs currently running, each of which reference the same libraries, and you load up all of that, it takes up a lot of memory space—that’s 20 times the memory space.
  The way Windows gets around this problem is by using what we call dynamic linking, which means each library can have its own memory space and exist independently of other executables. If executables want to access the library, they can use something called dynamic linking and share the memory space. Sounds pretty efficient, right?
  But malware authors have been exploiting this technique for ages now on Windows using DLL injection, which you might have heard of, and a lot of other techniques through which they can do their dirty work using a separate executable or a system executable. By the way, if you’re one of those people who relies on Task Manager to find malware, this is something that you should be aware of because if a malicious DLL is injected into a legitimate process, you will not see a malware process running in memory because it’s not—it’s a legitimate executable. It could very well be an essential Windows operating system one that would be carrying out the malicious
  activities because it’s actually executing functions that are part of the malicious DLL file.

file visualizer: |
  There are obfuscators out there that are used for legitimate programs that
  want to hide their internal workings and make it difficult to analyse the code that do exactly this.
  The tool basically inserts a bunch of random nonsense throughout the executable but does so in a
  manner that would never result in those instructions being executed.
  You''ll usually see this being called "dead code injection" or something like that in the tool's features list.
